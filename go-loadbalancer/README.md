# Build A Loadbalancer with Golang

---
## Introduction
This project is a load balancer built with Golang. It is a program that keeps track of which server has the most traffic and which server is available. It then decides which server to send traffic to. The load balancer uses the round robin method to route traffic between servers. This method is the simplest way to route traffic between servers. The load balancer also uses a reverse proxy server to redirect requests and hide the location of the server from the client.

### Load Balancer
A load balancer is a device or software application that distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers. This distribution helps to improve the performance, reliability, and scalability of web applications and services.

## Features

- **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
- **Round robin algorithm**: A simple method for distributing traffic evenly among servers.
- **Reverse proxy**: Hides the location of the server from the client and provides additional security and performance benefits.
- **Golang**: A modern programming language that is well-suited for building network applications.
